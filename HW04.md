Homework 4, due February 5th, 11:59pmJanuary 29, 2026Implement the TISP variable selection method for classification (as described in pages 12 of the Regularized Loss course notes), with the hard-thresholding penalty, (which is described in page 11, where you take $\eta=0$) and 100 iterations. Take special care to normalize each column of the X matrix to have zero mean and variance 1, and to use the same mean and standard deviation that you used for normalizing the train set also for normalizing the test set.a) Using the Gisette data, find appropriate thresholds $\lambda$ to select approximately 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000 features. Plot the train misclassification error vs iteration number when selecting 1000 features. Plot the final train and test misclassification error vs the number of selected features using a semilogx plot. Report in a table the train and test misclassification errors, the test AUC (area under the ROC curve), the corresponding numbers of selected features, the values of $\lambda$ and the training time. (2 points)b) Repeat point a) on the dexter dataset. (2 points)Implement the FSA variable selection method for linear models and binary classification with the logistic loss from page 4 of the FSA slides. Use the parameter $s=0.001$, $\mu=100$, $N^{iter}=100.$ Take special care to normalize each column of the X matrix to have zero mean and variance 1 and to use the same mean and standard deviation that you used for normalizing the train set also for normalizing the test set.a) Using the Gisette data, train a FSA classifier on the training set, starting with $\beta^{(0)}=0$ to select k ∈ {10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 3000} features. Plot the training loss vs iteration number for $k=1000$ Report in a table the train and test misclassification errors for the models obtained for all these k, the test AUC (area under the ROC curve) and the training time for each model. How do these training times compare with the corresponding TISP training times from 1a)? On the same semilogx plot, display the train/test misclassification errors vs k together with the corresponding train/test errors obtained at 1a) above. (2 points)b) Repeat point a) on the dexter dataset. (2 points)
